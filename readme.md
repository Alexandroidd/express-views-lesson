# Views in Express

<!--9:35 5 minutes -->

<!-- Raise your hand if you're tired of displaying JSON day in and day out.  Today, we're going to give some more power to our back-end.  Today, we will introduce server-side rendering, creating pages with the full support of all three amigos: HTML, CSS, and JS. -->

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- **Create** and **render** views in an Express application
- **Implement** and **use** a variety of Express middleware
- **Explain** the differences between views and partials in EJS
- **Render** partials and iterate over data in views

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- **Write** express controllers and models
- **Connect** Express models to Mongoose/MongoDB

## Views in Express - Intro

A lot of times, if we're looking to get a prototype up and running, we'll want to use a templating engine. Using Express out of the box, the view engine is Jade - an engine very similar to haml that relies on white space.  But if you're not familiar with haml - as we're not - EJS is another alternative that's easy to set up and does not rely on white space.

We are going to return to our `candies` app to focus on how to add views using EJS, include partials and pass data to those views.

<!--9:40 10 minutes -->

## Setting up our app to use EJS - Catch-up

First, let's require `ejs` in our applications `package.json`.  In dependencies, add:

```json
"ejs": "^2.4.2",
```

where you see

`// require ejs 2.4.2 //`

...and then:

`npm install`

Now, let's take a look at our `app.js` file and add the following:

```javascript
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.engine('ejs', require('ejs').renderFile);
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

Let's look at a few things going on here: `path` is a core Node module dealing with paths.  In our example, we've added the [path.join()](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_join_path1_path2) method. For us, this normalizes all the arguments into a path string which will help when we use the `__dirname` global variable and a file or folder.  After adding this, our Node app's view folder will look like:  `app/views`

The second `app.set()` tells Express to use the ejs templating engine. This allows you to embed JavaScript to work with data (especially with conditionals and loops) in your views.  For example, we can choose not to render partials if a user is already logged in. The file path to your view files now will end in `.ejs`

The middle line requires the `ejs` module in our app for files it encounters with the `.ejs` file extension. More specifically, it requires the `renderFile` method we used earlier.

Since we're ready to use `.ejs` now, let's set up our file structure to make sure our application can call the files properly. Create the following folder structure:

```
- views/
----- partials/
-------- candy/
------------ form.ejs
----- layout.ejs

```

#### More Middleware We Might Use:
* [EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)
* [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)
* [method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override)
* [lazy-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazy-cache)
* [express-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-helpers)
* [path](https://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/file-system/how-to-use-the-path-module/)
* [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
* [cookie-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser)

## Set up your form - Independent Practice

Ok, you've done this before.  Set up your form real quick in `candy/form.ejs` with:

- A heading that says "Create Candy!"
- A form with a POST method that submits to the `/candies` endpoint
- Two inputs for name and color that have placeholders
- A submit button

<!--
> Note: Provide students with the correct answer once time is up

```html
<h3>Create Candy!</h3>
<fieldset>
  <form method="POST" action="/candies">
    <input name="name" placeholder="Name"/>
    <input name="color" placeholder="Color"/>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</fieldset>
```
-->

<!--10:00 15 minutes -->

## Set up our layout to iterate over data - Catch-up

Let's create an index page that will double as our form.  But first let's make sure our application is set up to pass data from our database to our views if a user visits the `/candies` endpoint.

First, in our `config/routes.js` file, let's make sure our app can both get a list of all the candies and post a new candy from the same endpoint:

```javascript
var candiesController = require('../controllers/candies');

// http://127.0.0.1:3000/candies
router.route('/candies')

//GET all candies
   .get(candiesController.getAll)

//POST a new blob
   .post(candiesController.createCandy);
```

First, we require the controllers, then we set the candies routes and the `GET` AND `POST` actions that will occur when hitting this endpoint.  Now let's define these methods in our controller: `.getAll` and `.createCandy`.  We'll need to set up error handling and serve the response to the correct view with `.render`.  First, let's start with the `.getAll` function, together:

```javascript
// GET
function getAll(request, response) {
  Candy.find(function(error, candies) {
    if(error) response.json({message: 'Could not find any candy'});
    console.log("Rendering candies");
    response.render('layout', {candies: candies});
  });
}
```

<!-- Start server and go to http://localhost:3000/candies --we won't see anything but there will be a note in the console. -->

## Write a `createCandy` method that will pull from `name` and `color` inputs - Independent Practice (5 mins)

```javascript
// POST
function createCandy(request, response) {

  // fill in your code here

  candy.save(function(error) {
    if(error) response.json({messsage: 'Could not ceate candy b/c:' + error});

    response.redirect('/candies');
  });  
}
```

<!--
> Note: Provide students with the correct answer once time is up

    ```
    console.log('in POST');
    console.log('body:',request.body);
    var candy = new Candy();

    candy.name = request.body.name;
    candy.color = request.body.color;
    ```
-->

<!--10:15 15 minutes -->

## Let's make our layout! Code along

First, all the header stuff is exactly the same as it would be in a `.html` file - in `layout.ejs`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Candy App</title>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheets/main.css" />
</head>
```

<!--Show what localhost:3000/candies looks like at this point -->

Even though this is an `.ejs` file we're able to write html because we've set up our app to use the ejs templating engine, which can render HTML **and** embedded JavaScript.

Now, we're going to do two things.  First, because we're we're pulling `candies` from our database, we'll have access to all of our `candies` and their associated attributes.  So let's iterate over that array with JavaScript.  Just like earlier, we specify that what's being read is JavaScript with opening and closing `<% %>`, if we want the code to execute; with `<%= %>` if we want the code to execute **and render** on the browser. 

> Note: Recent versions of EJS have [a few more options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs#tags)

Now let's create a `<body>` and show all of our candies, with their name and color:

```html
<body>
  <h1>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKli0y-Xr-Q">Candy Shoppe</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="container">
  <% for(var i=0; i< candies.length; i++) {  %>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name : </b> <%= candies[i].name %></li>
      <li><b>Color : </b> <%= candies[i].color %></li>
    </ul>
  <% } %>
  </div>
</body>
```

Now we can use partials within our layout.ejs page.  The method we use is `include`:

```html
...
    <hr>
    <div class="container">
        <% include ./partials/candy/form %>
    </div>
...
```

Now your `layout.ejs` page should look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Candy App</title>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheets/main.css" /></head>
<body>
    <h1>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKli0y-Xr-Q">Candy Shoppe</a>
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
    <% for(var i=0; i< candies.length; i++) {  %>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name : </b> <%= candies[i].name %></li>
      <li><b>Color : </b> <%= candies[i].color %></li>
    </ul>
    <% } %>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <div class="container">
        <% include ./partials/candy/form %>
    </div>

</body>
</html>
```

## Independent Practice (15 mins)

> ***Note:*** This can be a pair programming activity or done independently

Expand on this application by doing the following:

- Create a footer as a separate partial and render it in the layout.ejs file
  - In the footer add in "Candies Â©"
- Add a link to an update page to each candy on your `/candies` page, with the `link_to` helper\*
  - This link should go to `edit/<candy_id>`, and should say "Update"
  - If your link is appearing a `<a href...` instead of a blue hyperlink, try using `<%-` instead of `<%=`
- Create an edit page where users can edit information about their candy
  - You will need to create a route for this first
  - You can re-use your candy form file for the page, however, make sure you use the "PATCH" method instead of "POST"
  - The update functionality is written for you already!
